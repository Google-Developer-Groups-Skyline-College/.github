# Security Policy

This document concerns our Chapter's general security policy for projects and their corresponding repositories.

## 🛠️ Project-Specific Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| All Current Builds (excludes Legacy) | :white_check_mark: |

We currently rely on Dependabot and CodeQL code-scanning on our repositories to monitor for new potential vulnerabilities in all pushes. 

We, however, need accountable auditing for cases that circumvent that first automated line of defense.

## 🔐 Reporting a Vulnerability

⚠️ If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly resolve surmised problems.

To contact us, email `security@skycs.club` to disclose said potential vulnerabilities.

Urgent? Please contact Chapter Administrators privately via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/z5P9kccwRh) to raise a more immediate resolution.
